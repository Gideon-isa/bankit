## General Knowledge

### 1.1. What are the key security considerations when developing financial applications?

When developing financial applications in the Nigerian fintech ecosystem, security is paramount due to the sensitive nature of financial data, regulatory requirements, and the potential for cybercrime.

- **Strong Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data storage.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to CBN, NDIC, etc.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Protect the application by requiring multiple authentication steps.

### 1.2. Question 2 - Describe the importance of compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and GDPR in financial applications.

### Answer:
Complliance standars like PCI-DSS and GDPR are essential building block for trust, safety and Legal securityin the financial technology space. They help you protect your users' data, avoid costly mistakes, and create a reputation for reliability and security. Reasons include:

**Protecting Customers Data** -  When people trust financial applications with their sensitive data—whether it's credit card details, bank account numbers, or personal identification—they expect that data to be kept safe. Compliance standards like PCI-DSS set specific requirements to ensure that payment card information is stored, processed, and transmitted securely. In simple terms, without these standards, a financial app is more likely to become a target for hackers, putting users' money and personal details at risk.service.

**Legal and Financial Consequences** - it's also about avoiding the serious legal and financial consequences that come from non-compliance.

If a company gets breached and is found to be in violation of PCI-DSS, the consequences can be severe. This includes fines, damage to the company’s reputation, and even the ability to process payments being revoked. For a Nigerian fintech startup trying to grow its user base, a payment breach could mean losing partnerships with payment processors or suspension of service.

### 1.3. Qustion 3 - Explain the concept of "idempotency" in financial transactions and why it's crucial.

### Answer:
he concept of idempotency in financial transactions refers to the property where repeating the same transaction multiple times produces the same result, without causing unintended side effects or duplicating the operation. In other words, if a transaction is submitted more than once (either due to retries, system failures, or user actions), the outcome should remain consistent.

**Benefits includes:**
-- Preventing Duplicate Charges
-Handling Network or System Failures
-Consistency and Reliability
-Fraud Prevention

### Question 4 - What are the potential risks of handling sensitive customer data, and how can they be mitigated?

### Answer:
n Nigeria’s rapidly growing fintech sector, where digital transactions and financial services are becoming mainstream, the stakes are high. Customer data includes personal identifiers, financial information, transaction history, and more, all of which, if exposed or mishandled, could lead to severe consequences.
Here are some of the potential risks and ways to mitigate them:

1. Data Breaches

### Mitigation for Data breaches includes:

**Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (while moving across networks) and at rest (when stored in databases or servers). This ensures that even if the data is intercepted or accessed, it cannot be read without the decryption key.

**Access Control:** Implement strict access control policies. Only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive data. Use role-based access and the principle of least privilege.

**Regular Audits and Monitoring:** Continuously monitor systems for suspicious activities and conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and address them proactively.n.

## Backend Development

### 2.1. Question 1: . Explain the importance of ACID properties in financial applications and how they
apply to databases

### Answers
ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—are crucial for ensuring reliable and accurate transactions in financial applications.

**Atomicity:** Ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully or none are. This prevents incomplete or erroneous transactions, which is vital in financial systems where partial transactions can lead to inconsistent data (e.g., transferring funds but failing to update the balance).

**Consistency:** Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, preserving data integrity. This ensures that after a financial transaction (e.g., fund transfer), the system remains in a correct state, maintaining valid account balances.

**Isolation:** Prevents transactions from interfering with each other. It ensures that even if multiple transactions are happening simultaneously, each transaction's operations are isolated until completed, preventing issues like double-spending.

**Durability:** Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanent, even in the event of a system failure. This ensures that financial records are safe and cannot be lost once the transaction is finalized.

Together, these properties are essential for maintaining the integrity, reliability, and security of financial transactions in databases.

### 2.2. Question 2. What is the role of encryption in securing bank transactions?

### Answers
Encryption plays a critical role in securing bank transactions by ensuring that sensitive data is protected during transmission and storage. Here's how it helps:

**Data Protection During Transmission:** When a customer initiates a transaction, encryption (such as SSL/TLS) ensures that the data, including account details, payment information, and personal identifiers, is securely transmitted over the internet. This prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting or tampering with the data during transfer.

**Protecting Stored Data:** Encryption ensures that sensitive information stored in a bank’s databases (e.g., customer account details, transaction history) is unreadable without the proper decryption key. This safeguards data from unauthorized access, even if the database is compromised.

**Prevention of Fraud:** By making data unreadable to anyone without the decryption key, encryption helps prevent fraudsters from stealing or manipulating sensitive transaction data, protecting both customers and banks.

### 2.3. Question 3. Describe how you would implement a secure login system using JWT tokens

### Answers

Implementing a secure login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) involves several key steps to ensure security and proper functionality.

**Firstly is the User Authentication (Login):**
The user provides their credentials (e.g., username and password) through a login form.
The server verifies the credentials against the database.
If the credentials are correct, a token gneratation
User ID: To identify the user.
Expiration Time (exp): To limit the lifespan of the token (e.g., 1 hour).
Other Claims: Optional data like roles or permissions

**Secondly is the  Token Signing:**
The server signs the JWT using a secret key (for HMAC algorithms) or a private key (for RSA or ECDSA algorithms).
This ensures that the token can be trusted and verified by the server later.

**Thirdly is the Token Storage:**
After a successful login, the server sends the JWT back to the client (usually in the response body).
This needs to stores the token securely. I will then implement to store the token

**Fourthly  is the Authorization with JWT:**
For subsequent requests , the client sends the JWT token in the Authorization header (with the "Bearer" scheme). I will use this to authenticate the user.

Next would be the Token Verification on the Sever. This will be implimented using the token signature, expiration date.

**lastly is generating a refresh token:**
Once the token is expires, I will generates a refresh token mechanism.

### 2.4. Question 5. . How would you handle concurrent transactions to prevent double spending or data inconsistencies?

### Answer
To achieve this, you need to employ various techniques that ensure data integrity and prevent conflicts in multi-user environments. Here’s how to manage this:

1. Transactional Integerity using the ACID properties
2. Using the Locking Mechanisim
3. Using Queues and Message Brokers
4. Audit Logging

## Conclusion

In summary, securing financial applications, ensuring compliance, maintaining data integrity, and preventing fraud are all crucial elements when developing fintech applications. By adhering to these best practices, you can build a robust and secure financial system.
